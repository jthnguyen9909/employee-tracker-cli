## Usage

After the user runs the command 'npm i' to install the application's dependencies, they can run 'node index.js' to start the application and they are presented with various options to interact with the employee database. The information will be formatted visually using the console.table package and feature other related data depending on the option chosen. The application also features the dotenv package that allows users to store their environment variables so that their private data is not shared publicly.
